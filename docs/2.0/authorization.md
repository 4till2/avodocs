# Authorization

When you share access to Avo with your clients or large teams, you may want to restrict access to a resource or a subset of resources. One example may be that only admin-level users may delete or update records.

By default, Avo leverages Pundit under the hood to manage the authorization.

:::info Pundit alternative
Pundit is just the default choice. You may plug in your own client using the instructions [here](#custom-authorization-clients).
:::

## Make sure Avo knows who your current user is

Before setting any policies up, please ensure Avo knows your current user. Usually, this ðŸ‘‡ set up should be fine, but follow [the authentication guide](./authentication#customize-the-current-user-method) for more information.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_method = :current_user
end
```

## Policies

Just run the regular pundit `bin/rails g pundit:policy Post` to generate a new policy.

**If this is a new app you need to install pundit first <code>bin/rails g pundit:install</code>.**

With this new policy, you may control what every type o user can do with Avo. The policy has the default methods for the regular controller actions: `index?`, `show?`, `create?`, `new?`, `update?`, `edit?` and `destroy?`.

These methods control whether the resource appears on the sidebar, if the view/edit/destroy buttons are visible or if a user has access to those index/show/edit/create pages.

### index?

`index?` is used to display/hide the resources on the sidebar and restrict access to the resources **Index** view.

:::info
  This option is used in the **auto-generated menu**, not in the **menu editor**.

  You'll have to use your own logic in the [`visible`](./menu-editor#item-visibility) block for that.
:::

### show?

When setting `show?` to `false`, the user will not see the show icon on the resource row and will not have access to the **Show** view of a resource.

### create?

The `create?` method will prevent the users from creating a resource. That will also apply to the `Create new {model}` button on the `Index`, the `Save` button on the `/new` page, and `Create new {model}` button on the association `Show` page.

### new?

The `new?` method will control whether the users can save the new resource. You can also access the `record` variable with the form values pre-filled.

### edit?

`edit?` to `false` will hide the edit button on the resource row and prevent the user from seeing the edit view.

### update?

`update?` to `false` will prevent the user from updating a resource. You can also access the `record` variable with the form values pre-filled.

### destroy?

`destroy?` to `false` will prevent the user from destroying a resource and hiding the delete button.

### upload_attachments?

Controls whether the attachment upload input should be visible in the `File` and `Files` fields.

### download_attachments?

Controls whether the attachment download button should be visible in the `File` and `Files` fields.

### delete_attachments?

Controls whether the attachment delete button should be visible in the `File` and `Files` fields.

### act_on?

Controls whether the user can see the actions button on the `Index` page.

## Associations

When using relationships, you would like to set policies for `creating` new records on the association, allowing to `attach`, `detach`, `create` or `destroy` relevant records. Again, Avo makes this easy using a straightforward naming schema.

### attach_{association}?

When you have a `Post` resource with many `Comment`s through the `has_many :comments` association and want to authorize which users can attach `comments` to a post, you should define an `attach_comment?` policy on your post model's policy class. Use the association name as the suffix of the policy method.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/attach.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### detach_{association}?

`detach` method works similarly to `attach`, but for detaching.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/detach.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### view_{association}?

Controls whether the view button is visible on the associated record row on the `Index` page. This **does not** control whether the user has access to that record. You can control that using the Policy of that record.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/view.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### edit_{association}?

`edit` method works similarly to `attach`, but for editing.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/edit.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### create_{association}?

`create` method works similarly to `attach`, but for creating.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/create.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### destroy_{association}?

`destroy` method works similarly to `attach`, but for destroying.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/destroy.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

### act_on_{association}?

`act_on_` method works similarly to `attach`, but for showing actions.

<img :src="('/assets/img/authorization/actions.jpg')" class="border mb-4" />

## Scopes

You may specify a scope for the <Index />, <Show />, and <Edit /> views.

```ruby{3-9}
class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  class Scope < Scope
    def resolve
      if user.admin?
        scope.all
      else
        scope.where(published: true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Using different policy methods

By default Avo will use the generated Pundit methods (`index?`, `show?`, `create?`, `new?`, `update?`, `edit?` and `destroy?`). But maybe, in your app, you're already using these methods and would like to use different ones for Avo. You may want override these methods inside your configuration with a simple map using the `authorization_methods` key.


```ruby{6-14}
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.root_path = '/avo'
  config.app_name = 'Avocadelicious'
  config.license = 'pro'
  config.license_key = ENV['AVO_LICENSE_KEY']
  config.authorization_methods = {
    index: 'avo_index?',
    show: 'avo_show?',
    edit: 'avo_edit?',
    new: 'avo_new?',
    update: 'avo_update?',
    create: 'avo_create?',
    destroy: 'avo_destroy?',
  }
end
```

Now, Avo will use `avo_index?` instead of `index?` to manage the **Index** view authorization.

## Raise errors when policies are missing

The default behavior of Avo is to allow missing policies for resources silently. So, if you have a `User` model and a `UserResource` but don't have a `UserPolicy`, Avo will not raise errors regarding missing policies and authorize that resource.

If, however, you need to be on the safe side of things and raise errors when a Resource is missing a Policy, you can toggle on the `raise_error_on_missing_policy` configuration.

```ruby{7}
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.root_path = '/avo'
  config.app_name = 'Avocadelicious'
  config.license = 'pro'
  config.license_key = ENV['AVO_LICENSE_KEY']
  config.raise_error_on_missing_policy = true
end
```

Now, you'll have to provide a policy for each resource you have in your app, thus making it a more secure app.

## Custom policies

<VersionReq version="2.17" />

By default, Avo will infer the policy from the model of the resource object. If you wish to use a different policy for a given resource, you can specify it directly in the resource using the `authorization_policy` option.

```ruby
class PhotoCommentResource < Avo::BaseResource
  self.model_class = ::Comment
  self.authorization_policy = PhotoCommentPolicy
  # ...
end
```

## Custom authorization clients

:::info
Check out the [Pundit client](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/blob/main/lib/avo/services/authorization_clients/pundit_client.rb) for reference.
:::

### Client methods

Each authorization client must expose a few methods.

### `authorize`

Receives the `user`, `record`, `action`, and optionally, the `policy_class` and authorizez that action

```ruby
# Pundit example
def authorize(user, record, action, policy_class: nil)
  Pundit.authorize(user, record, action, policy_class: policy_class)
rescue Pundit::NotDefinedError => error
  raise NoPolicyError.new error.message
rescue Pundit::NotAuthorizedError => error
  raise NotAuthorizedError.new error.message
end
```

### `policy`

Receives the `user` and `record` and returns the policy to use.

```ruby
def policy(user, record)
  Pundit.policy(user, record)
end
```

### `policy!`

Receives the `user` and `record` and returns the policy to use. It will raise an error if no policy is found.

```ruby
def policy!(user, record)
  Pundit.policy!(user, record)
rescue Pundit::NotDefinedError => error
  raise NoPolicyError.new error.message
end
```

### `apply_policy`

Receives the `user`, `record`, and optionally, the policy class to use. It will apply a scope to a query.

```ruby
def apply_policy(user, model, policy_class: nil)
  # Try and figure out the scope from a given policy or auto-detected one
  scope_from_policy_class = scope_for_policy_class(policy_class)

  # If we discover one use it.
  # Else fallback to pundit.
  if scope_from_policy_class.present?
    scope_from_policy_class.new(user, model).resolve
  else
    Pundit.policy_scope!(user, model)
  end
rescue Pundit::NotDefinedError => error
  raise NoPolicyError.new error.message
end
```
